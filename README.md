# DeskCloud 

Remember making beats with pens in high school and middle school? 

DeskCloud can turn your day dream beats into income !!

This project uses openCV to track the movement of a pen and a "playing surface" and plays sounds when a 
collision is detected between the two. DeskCloud can also tell the difference between which part of the
pen is hitting the playing surface and play a different note accordingly. 

## Using DeskCloud 

you need to give us permission to access your webcam. Once this step is complete you will be able to see
your webcam feed in the browser as well as a small tool bar to define your beats and to stop/start the
recording of your beat.
